2008) How the Burrows-Wheeler Transform works. In: The Burrows-Wheeler Transform: Data Compression, Suffix Arrays, and Pattern Matching. Springer, Boston, MA. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-78909-5_2

Explains how the BWT works. This chapter also contains psudocode, which will be helpful for us in recreating this aspect of the bzip2 process.
